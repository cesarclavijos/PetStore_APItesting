“PetStore” Testing and automated checks challenge - adidas app team
Description of the problem:
"We are the business stakeholders of PetStore API. We don't understand a lot about testing, or automated checks,
 but we're looking for someone who can define a simple and easy to work with automated check suite for PetStore API (https://petstore.swagger.io/ ). 
 The PetStore API has 3 main services: store, user and pet. We're not telling you upfront which service we think is more important, we leave that up to you, as a Testing expert.
  You're expected to create automated checks for only ONE of the services that you think is “mission critical”. 
  The automated checks suite should cover the most critical flows you can think about of the service you've chosen."

What we expect from you:
- This is an open challenge, you are allowed to choose the programming language, frameworks and tools to use.
- You should be able to explain why you’ve chosen a particular service opposite to the others.
- Provide a README document as a summary with the guidelines of the taken approach, the decisions made (e.g. selection criteria for tool, language, framework, etc.).
- We'd really appreciate if you could include detailed steps to run the checks (setup needed, if any) too, the solution you develop needs to run.
- Share any test notes, bugs and confusion you've taken notice of while exploring your chosen service of the API in a TEST-NOTES document.
- When you are done, please check your solution into any public GIT repo (e.g. GitHub/Bitbucket/Gitlab) and send us the link.
- Now, finally, we don't limit you on anything. If you feel uncomfortable working with something, didn't have enough free time, skip it, and explain why you skipped, 
and what detailed approach would you take to solve what you skipped. Keep in mind – we’re interested in what you deliver – but make a smart use of your time – 
opt for Quality over Quantity.o
